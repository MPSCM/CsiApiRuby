But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Computer, belay that order. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Your shields were failing, sir. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. You enjoyed that. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Travel time to the nearest starbase? I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. They were just sucked into space. The unexpected is our normal routine. Your head is not an artifact! Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. This should be interesting. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. Sorry, Data. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns.

Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Your head is not an artifact! Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. How long can two people talk about nothing? Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Sorry, Data. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? Besides, you look good in a dress. Not if I weaken first. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane.</LongWaiver><SiteDisplayInstructor>false</SiteDisplayInstructor></Value><IsException>false</IsException></GetWaiverByScheduleIdResult></GetWaiverByScheduleIdResponse></soap:Body></soap:Envelope>
